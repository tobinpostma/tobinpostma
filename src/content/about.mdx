After 15+ years working in senior roles in local government with the City of Vancouver and at ArcelorMittal, a multinational steel and mining organization, I took a leap year in 2021 to give myself the freedom to learn how to listen to, and ultimately lead, with my heart.

I discovered that my heart beats strongest when I am able to help others who want to have a positive impact on this earth and her guests.

"It's never been done before"

"We don't know where to begin"

"We don't know what to do now"

These are the kind of problem statements that I am compelled to run towards. Whether you need a running partner or a thought partner I will bring my energy and experience to assist you on your journey as you tackle our biggest intractable problems.

I am a solutions-driven, creative problem solver who brings joyful energy into everything I do – like a breath of fresh air, invigorating your organization. Just as a change of scenery can provide greatly-needed perspective, I help identify leverage points and new ways to approach points of friction.

I thrive in emergent situations especially those characterized by unpredictability and ambiguity – providing a calm, steady and pragmatic hands-on approach.

I understand how to bridge bottom-up solutions with policy design, moving seamlessly between the shop floor and the top floor.

I am a locksmith, silobuster and a story teller.

I am a global explorer, adept at navigating organizations, personalities, and challenges of all types and sizes and I am eager to join you on your journey towards impactful change.
